A procedurally generated world builder project I started to work on.

So far there's minimal user interaction:
A random world will be generated (random tree and rock placement, same lake function)
BUT only a small segment of the world is rendered and you can move around with the arrows to explore the entire map.
and also you can place trees, which is quite nice
